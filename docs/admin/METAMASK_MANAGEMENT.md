# MetaMask Connection Management for Administrators

This guide explains how to use the Mantle-Gain admin interface to manage MetaMask wallet connections, review disconnection requests, and maintain the security of user wallet connections.

## Overview

The MetaMask connection management system provides administrators with tools to:

1. View all active MetaMask connections
2. Process wallet disconnection requests
3. Audit connection history
4. Manage security notifications

## Accessing the Admin Interface

1. Navigate to [Admin Dashboard](https://app.mantle-gain.cc/admin)
2. Log in with your admin credentials
3. Select "MetaMask Management" from the sidebar menu

## Dashboard Overview

The MetaMask admin dashboard displays:

- Total active connections
- Pending disconnection requests (with count badge)
- Recent connection activities
- Flagged connections (suspicious activity)

## Managing Disconnection Requests

### Viewing Requests

1. Go to the "Pending Requests" tab
2. Each request includes:
   - User email
   - Wallet address
   - Connection timestamp
   - Disconnection reason
   - Request date

### Processing Requests

To approve a disconnection request:

1. Review the request details
2. Click "Approve" to process the request
3. Add an optional note for internal tracking
4. Confirm the action

The system will:
- Update the connection status
- Send a confirmation email to the user
- Log the action in the admin audit trail

To reject a disconnection request:

1. Click "Reject"
2. Provide a reason for rejection
3. Confirm the action

The system will:
- Keep the connection active
- Notify the user of the rejection with the provided reason
- Log the action in the admin audit trail

## Connection History

The "Connection History" section provides:

- Complete history of all MetaMask connections
- Filtering by date range, status, and wallet address
- Export functionality (CSV/PDF)
- Detailed activity logs per connection

## Security Features

### Manual Security Review

For connections flagged by the system:

1. Review the flagged connection details
2. Check the suspicious activity indicators
3. Take appropriate action:
   - Clear flag (false positive)
   - Contact user (for verification)
   - Force disconnect (security risk)

### Bulk Actions

For system maintenance:

- **Audit All**: Trigger a security review of all connections
- **Notify Users**: Send batch notifications to connected users
- **Export Data**: Generate reports for compliance purposes

## Email Notifications

The system sends the following email notifications:

1. **To Users**:
   - Disconnection request received
   - Request approved/rejected
   - Security alerts

2. **To Admins**:
   - New disconnection requests
   - Security warnings
   - Weekly connection summary

## Best Practices

1. **Response Time**: Process disconnection requests within 24-48 hours
2. **Documentation**: Add detailed notes to rejection reasons
3. **Verification**: For suspicious requests, use secondary verification channels
4. **Regular Audits**: Review connection logs weekly
5. **User Communication**: Maintain clear communication about request status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Delivery Problems**:
   - Check spam filters
   - Verify email templates
   - Test notification system

2. **User Complaints**:
   - Prioritize urgent security concerns
   - Document all user interactions
   - Escalate unresolved issues

3. **Data Inconsistencies**:
