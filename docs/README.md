## Overview

Mantle-Gain is an AI-powered cross-chain yield aggregator that automatically allocates funds to the highest-yielding opportunities across multiple blockchains. The platform combines advanced algorithms with real-time data analysis to optimize investment strategies for both retail and institutional users.

Founded in 2025, Mantle-Gain aims to make DeFi more accessible, efficient, and secure for users worldwide.

## Architecture

The Mantle-Gain platform consists of several key components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts deployed on Ethereum and compatible networks
2. **Frontend Application**: Next.js web application providing a user interface
3. **Middleware Services**: API endpoints for data processing and blockchain interactions
4. **AI Optimization Engine**: Algorithms for yield strategy optimization
5. **Multi-Chain Bridge**: Infrastructure for cross-chain asset transfers and yield farming

## Smart Contracts

Mantle-Gain's core functionality is implemented in the following smart contracts:

- [YieldAggregator](./CONTRACT_INTERACTIONS.md#yieldaggregator): Central contract for user deposits and withdrawals
- [StrategyFactory](./OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md): Factory pattern for creating and managing yield strategies
- [Specialized Strategy Contracts](./CONTRACT_INTERACTIONS.md#strategy-contracts): Implementations for various yield strategies (Lending, Farming, Liquidity)
- [MultiSigWallet](./EMERGENCY_FEATURES.md#multi-signature-wallet): Secure governance contract for administrative operations

For detailed information on contract optimizations, see [Optimization Strategy](./OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md).

For emergency features and security measures, see [Emergency Features](./EMERGENCY_FEATURES.md).

For contract interactions and function descriptions, see [Contract Interactions](./CONTRACT_INTERACTIONS.md).

## Frontend Application

The Mantle-Gain frontend is built using Next.js 15, React 18, and Tailwind CSS. Key features include:

- Responsive dashboard for portfolio management
- Real-time yield opportunity tracking
- Interactive investment management interface
- Secure wallet connection using MetaMask and WalletConnect
- Cross-chain asset bridging and transfer interface
