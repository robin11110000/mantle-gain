# Mantle-Gain Contract Optimization Strategy

## Contract Size Issue

During development of the Mantle-Gain protocol, we encountered a significant limitation with the StrategyFactory contract:

```
Warning: Contract code size is 31658 bytes and exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon).
This contract may not be deployable on Mainnet.
```

Ethereum has a maximum contract size limit of 24,576 bytes (introduced in the Spurious Dragon hard fork), but our original StrategyFactory contract was 31,658 bytes. This contract size limitation is a fundamental constraint in Ethereum's architecture and cannot be bypassed directly.

## Optimization Strategy

To address this issue, we implemented a comprehensive optimization strategy:

### 1. Split Contract Architecture

We refactored our monolithic StrategyFactory into a modular architecture:

- **StrategyFactoryLib**: A library containing common utility functions
- **BaseStrategyFactory**: An abstract base contract with shared functionality
- **Specialized Factory Contracts**:
  - LendingStrategyFactory
  - FarmingStrategyFactory
  - LiquidityStrategyFactory
- **MasterStrategyFactory**: A coordinator contract that manages all specialized factories

This approach follows the pattern of "horizontal splitting" of contracts, which is a recommended practice for complex DeFi protocols.

### 2. Solidity Optimizer Configuration

We adjusted the Solidity compiler settings in `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
solidity: {
  version: "0.8.17",
  settings: {
    optimizer: {
      enabled: true,
      runs: 1,  // Low "runs" value optimizes for contract size over gas efficiency
      details: {
        yul: true,
        yulDetails: {
          stackAllocation: true,
          optimizerSteps: 15
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Setting `runs: 1` instructs the optimizer to prioritize contract size over gas efficiency, which is appropriate for contracts approaching the size limit.

### 3. Library Usage

We moved reusable code to the `StrategyFactoryLib` library, which:
- Reduces code duplication
- Allows for code reuse across multiple contracts
- Reduces the bytecode size of contracts that use the library

### 4. Function Signature Optimization

We standardized function signatures and naming across all factories to:
- Improve code readability
- Make the codebase more maintainable
- Allow for better compiler optimizations

## Testing Strategy

We implemented comprehensive testing to ensure the optimized contracts function correctly:

1. **Individual Component Tests**: Each specialized factory contract is tested in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing the entire factory ecosystem working together
3. **Strategy Deployment Tests**: Verifying that strategies can be deployed through the factory
4. **Deposit and Withdrawal Tests**: Ensuring funds move correctly through the system
5. **Fee Collection Tests**: Validating that fees are collected and distributed appropriately
6. **Emergency Scenario Tests**: Testing the pause/unpause and emergency function capabilities

## Deployability Benefits

This optimization strategy provides several key benefits:

1. **Mainnet Deployability**: All contracts are now well under the 24KB size limit
2. **Reduced Gas Costs**: Smaller, more focused contracts typically require less gas to deploy
3. **Better Upgradability**: Modular architecture allows for upgrading individual components
4. **Enhanced Security**: Smaller contracts are easier to audit and reason about
5. **Improved Maintainability**: Specialized contracts have clearer responsibilities

## Future Considerations

As the protocol evolves, we recommend:

1. Monitoring contract sizes during development
2. Running regular bytecode size checks as part of the CI/CD pipeline
3. Considering further optimization techniques for complex contracts:
   - Using events instead of state variables where appropriate
   - Carefully choosing variable types and sizes
   - Consolidating similar functions

By implementing these strategies, we've successfully addressed the contract size limitation while maintaining the full functionality of the StrategyFactory system.
