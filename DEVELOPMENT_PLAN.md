# Mantle-Gain Development Plan

## Project Overview
Mantle-Gain is a cross-chain yield aggregator built on Mantle, designed to help users maximize their yield across multiple blockchain networks through the Mantle ecosystem. The application will use MongoDB for data storage and will be developed according to Mantle Hub requirements.

## 🎯 Hackathon Requirements

### Basic Requirements
- Project must follow Mantle design guidelines (from [contracts.mantle.io](https://contracts.mantle.io/))
- Project must be open-source
- Team members must verify identity on OpenGuild Discord
- Valid commit history showing contribution during the hackathon
- Set up a Mantle wallet with on-chain identity for verification

### Submission Requirements
- Project description (README, website, or documentation)
- Strong UI/UX focus alongside functionality
- Demo video or screenshots of the project
- Access to GitHub repository for judging panel
