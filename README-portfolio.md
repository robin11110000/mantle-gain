- Total portfolio value across all strategies
- Estimated annual yield and APY performance
- Detailed breakdown of each active position including:
  - Asset type and amount
  - Current value
  - Time in the strategy
  - Estimated APY
  - Accrued rewards
- Interactive controls to withdraw funds or claim rewards

### Transaction History

The Transaction History component provides:
- Chronological list of all user interactions with yield strategies
- Filtering options by asset, protocol, or transaction type
- Direct links to blockchain explorers for transaction verification

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:
- Unit tests for all React components
- API endpoint testing
- Mock implementations for blockchain interactions
- Test coverage for error handling and edge cases

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the Portfolio page from the main navigation
2. Connect your wallet to view your active positions
3. Use the tabs to switch between "Positions" and "Transaction History" views
4. Interact with positions directly through the UI

## Development

To extend the portfolio functionality:
1. Add new transaction types in the Transaction model
2. Implement additional filters or sorting options in the API
3. Expand the UI to show more detailed analytics
